## Setup

{% if not installed %}

### Installation:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=kvj&repository=hass_nuki_ng&category=integration)

* Go to HACS -> Integrations
* Click the three dots on the top right and select `Custom Repositories`
* Enter `https://github.com/kvj/hass_nuki_ng` as repository, select the category `Integration` and click Add
* A new custom integration shows up for installation (Nuki Lock) - install it
* Restart Home Assistant

{% endif %}
  
### Configuration:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=nuki_ng)

* Go to Configuration -> Integrations
* Click `Add Integration`
* Search for `Nuki Lock` (not just `Nuki`, as this is the native integration from Home Assistant) and select it
* The integration will try to automatically discover your Nuki Bridge hostname or IP address, if you have a bridge
* It will also automatically enter the Home Assistant internal URL
* Provide either the Bridge API token and URL and/or a web API token and click Submit
* You can provide both, but you need to provide at least one
  
  
#### Bridge API Token:
The API token for the Nuki Bridge needs to be configured on the bridge, e.g. using the Nuki mobile app. The
[Home Assistant Nuki documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nuki/) explains it like this:

> To add a Nuki bridge to your installation, you need to enable developer mode on your bridge and define a port and an access token. This can be achieved using the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nuki) or [iPhone app](https://apps.apple.com/app/nuki-smart-lock/id1044998081). Go to manage my devices, and select the bridge. Within the bridge configuration turn on the HTTP API and check the details in the screen. Please note that the API token should be 6-20 characters long, even though the app allows you to set a longer one.
  
  
#### Web API Token:
* Go to the Nuki Web API management site at https://web.nuki.io/
* Nuki Web needs to be activated in the Nuki app - there is a link on the site that tells you how to do that
* Once activated, login on the web
* In the menu on the left, select API
* Click `Generate API token`
* Give it a name, leave the other settings as they are and click Save
* Copy the token and save it in a secure place. It will only be shown this once to you.
  
  
## Usage:

### Devices:

The integration provides several devices and entities to Home Assistant, depending on your setup. For example:

| Device            | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nuki Bridge       | Providing four diagnostic sensors about the state of the bridge.                                |
| Nuki Lock         | Providing one `lock` entity, three state sensors and eight diagnostic sensors about the lock.   |
| Nuki Opener       | Providing one `lock` entity, one state sensor and five diagnostic sensors about the opener.     |
| Nuki Web API      | Providing configuration `switch` entities for access permissions as set in the Nuki app.        |

In your setup, you could have several locks, but maybe no opener, no bridge or no web API.
  
  
### Entities:

#### Nuki Bridge:

| Entity ID                                      | Type        |  Description                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| binary_sensor.nuki_bridge_bridge_callback_set  | Diagnostic  | On, if the integration successfully registered a callback with the bridge  |
| binary_sensor.nuki_bridge_connected            | Diagnostic  | On, if the bridge is reachable via WiFi                                    |
| sensor.nuki_bridge_firmware_version            | Diagnostic  | The current firmware version of the bridge                                 |

#### Nuki Lock:

The entity IDs depend on the Nuki names of the lock. In the example below, it is `Wohnung`.

| Entity ID                                      | Type        | Description                                     |

| binary_sensor.nuki_wohnung_door_open           | Sensor      | Shows the state of the door                     |
| binary_sensor.nuki_wohnung_locked              | Sensor      | Shows the state of the lock                     |
| sensor.nuki_wohnung_door_security_state        | Sensor      | Combines the state of the door with the lock    |
| sensor.nuki_wohnung_battery                    | Diagnostic  | Shows the battery level of the lock             |
| binary_sensor.nuki_wohnung_battery_charging    | Diagnostic  | Shows if the battery is currently charging      |
| binary_sensor.nuki_wohnung_battery_critical    | Diagnostic  | Shows if the battery has a critical level       |
| sensor.nuki_wohnung_door_state                 | Diagnostic  | Shows the state of the door                     |
| sensor.nuki_wohnung_firmware_version           | Diagnostic  | Shows the current firmware of the lock          |
| binary_sensor.nuki_wohnung_keypad_battery_critical | Diagnostic | Shows if the battery of the keypad has a critical level |
| sensor.nuki_wohnung_rssi                       | Diagnostic  | Shows the received signal strength indicator of the lock   |
| sensor.nuki_wohnung_state                      | Diagnostic  | Shows the state of the lock                     |
  
  
#### Nuki Opener:

The entity IDs depend on the Nuki names of the lock. In the example below, it is `Haustur`.

| Entity ID                                      | Type        | Description                                     |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| lock.nuki_haustur_lock                         | Control     | The main entity to control the opener           |
| binary_sensor.nuki_haustur_locked              | Sensor      | Shows the state of the opener (locked or unlocked)  |
| binary_sensor.nuki_haustur_battery_critical    | Diagnostic  | Shows if the battery has a critical level       |
| sensor.nuki_haustur_firmware_version           | Diagnostic  | Shows the current firmware of the opener        |
| sensor.nuki_haustur_rssi                       | Diagnostic  | Shows the received signal strength indicator of the opener   |
| sensor.nuki_haustur_state                      | Diagnostic  | Shows the state of the opener (e.g., rto active)  |
  
  
#### Nuki Web API:

The entity IDs depend on the authorization you have given to your devices. There will be as many `switch` entities as
there are authorizations stored on the Nuki platform. While they are all named `switch.nuki_` followed by a descriptive
name, there are three different types:

| Type                                      | Example                                          |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization of local devices            | The keypad, which is granted access to the lock  |
| Authorization of access codes             | A code registered with the keypad                |
| Authorization of apps                     | Access granted to members of the family          |

## Useful tips

### Open/unlatch Nuki lock via UI

Even though the component supports the `lock.open` service and advertises support of it, Lovelace UI doesn't show any controls to trigger. This can be achieved via simple script similar to the one below:
```yaml
alias: Nuki Lock Open
sequence:
  - device_id: 8d159025411a270ecb9024794bc54361
    domain: lock
    entity_id: lock.nuki_front_door_lock
    type: open
mode: single
icon: mdi:lock-open
```

or manually calling the service:
```yaml
type: button
entity: lock.nuki_front_door_lock
tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: lock.open
  service_data: {}
  target:
    entity_id: lock.nuki_front_door_lock
name: Nuki
```
